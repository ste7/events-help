## Create account

Sign up for a Novacal account by providing your `email` address and creating a `password`, or using Google authentication.

## Onboarding process

Once your account is created, you'll go through a 5-step onboarding process to set up your scheduling preferences and connect your tools.

### Step 1: Set Up Personal Details

Enter your name and choose a username. Your username will form part of your public booking link (for example:{" "} <code className="bg-gray-100 px-1 py-0.5 rounded text-sm font-mono"> novacal.io/username </code> ), so select something that is clear and professional. You will also set your timezone, which ensures all scheduling is automatically adjusted for regional differences, and select your preferred time format (12-hour or 24-hour). The chosen format will be applied consistently across the platform.

### Step 2: Availability

Define your schedule and main availability. These settings determine the time windows when others can book meetings with you. By setting your working hours, Novacal ensures that bookings are only offered during the periods you want to be available.

### Step 3: Calendar connection

Connect your external calendars, including Google, Outlook, and Apple Calendar. You can specify which calendar Novacal should use to check for booking conflicts, ensuring meetings are never double-booked. You can also choose where new booked events should be automatically added, so your schedule always stays synchronized.

### Step 4: Video Conferencing Apps

Link conferencing tools such as Google Meet or Zoom. Novacal will use your selected app as the default meeting location for new event types, though this can be changed later at any time.

  Google Meet requires a connected Google Calendar with automatic event creation
  enabled to generate meeting links.

### Step 5: Profile details

Personalize your public booking page by uploading an avatar, writing a short “About” section, and adding social links. These details will be visible to anyone using your booking link, helping you create a professional and approachable presence.

Once onboarding is complete, your account is fully configured. We will generate default event types based on your configuration so you can start scheduling meetings right away.
