## How to Create Organization

Click on profile dropdown in top-left corner then **My Organization**. It will redirect you directly to onboarding:

1. **Organization Setup**: Enter your organization details: `email`, `name`, and `URL`.

2. **Set organization profile**: Add your organizationâ€™s `logo` and `about` information.

3. **Invite members**: Invite team members by entering their email addresses.

Once the setup is complete, your organization will be ready for team scheduling.
