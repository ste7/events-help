## Creating a Team

To create a team, go to the **Teams** section in your dashboard. If you don’t have a team yet, you’ll see a button to create one, which will redirect you to the onboarding process:

1. **Team Setup**: Enter your team details including `name` and `URL` (username).

2. **Team Profile**: Add your team's `logo` and `about` information to personalize your public booking page.

3. **Invite Members**: Invite team members by entering their email addresses.

## Team Features

### Collective Events

Create collective event types where multiple team members can be booked together. When attendees book a collective event, they book with all selected hosts, and the system automatically finds availability that works for all hosts.

### Team Members & Roles

Teams support two role levels:

- **Owner**: The team owner serves as the event organizer for all collective events. They have full control over the team, including settings, member management, and team deletion. The owner's connected accounts (video conferencing and calendars) are used for collective events, and all participants are automatically added to meetings and calendar events.
- **Member**: Can view the team and participate in collective events, but cannot manage settings or members

### Team Settings

Team owners can manage team settings:

- **Name**: Update your team's display name
- **URL**: Customize your team's public booking page URL
- **Logo**: Upload a team logo that appears on your public page
- **About**: Add a description of your team that appears on your public booking page
