To integrate PayPal you need to provide to Novacal 2 keys:

- `Client ID`
- `Secret Key`

To obtain these keys, log in to **PayPal** and go to the **Developer** section. Ensure that the **Live** environment is switched on, not Sandbox. Then, navigate to **Apps & Credentials** and click the **Create App** button. After creating the app, you will be able to find your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.
