The calendar gives you a complete view of your events and makes it easy to manage your schedule.  
You can switch between day, week, and month views to find the layout that works best for you.  
Click on any event to open its details, or simply drag and drop it to a new time slot if you need to reschedule.  
If something changes, you can also cancel an event directly from the calendar.
