The calendar provides a comprehensive view of all your scheduled events, giving you complete visibility into your booking schedule. You can switch between day, week, and month views to find the layout that works best for your workflow and planning needs. The calendar interface makes it easy to manage your events - click on any event to view its full details including client information and booking specifics, drag and drop events to reschedule them to different time slots, or cancel events directly when plans change. This centralized view helps you stay organized and ensures you never miss an important meeting or appointment.
