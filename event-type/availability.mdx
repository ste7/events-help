# Availability Settings

Configure when your event type is available for booking by setting your working hours, time zones, and availability rules.

## Default Scheduler

You can see and configure your default scheduler settings that apply to all days. This includes your standard working hours, time zone, and general availability rules.

## Override Availability

You can override the default availability for specific days. When you set an override for a particular day, that custom availability will be applied to all event types.

<Info>
  Overridden availability takes precedence over your default scheduler settings
  and applies to all event types for the specified days.
