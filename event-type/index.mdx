Event types define how people can book time with you. Each event type has its own settings, such as duration, availability, and location. When a client books an event type, Novacal uses these settings to create the booking automatically.

You can create multiple event types for different purposesâ€”for example, a 15-minute check-in, a 30-minute consultation, or a 60-minute meeting. Each event type can be customized with its own name, description, and rules, so clients know exactly what they're booking.

## Creating an Event Type

When creating a new event type, you can choose between two options:

**One-on-One Event Type**: For individual meetings, consultations, or appointments where each booking is for a single person.

**Group Event Type**: For workshops, webinars, or events where multiple people can attend the same session.

After selecting your preferred event type, you'll be redirected to the event type settings page where you can configure all the details including duration, availability, location, and more.

<Warning>
  You won't be able to change the event type (one-on-one or group) later, so
  choose carefully during the initial setup.
