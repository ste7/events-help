# Scheduling Limits

Configure scheduling limits to optimize your availability and ensure smooth meeting management. These settings help you maintain proper spacing between events, set appropriate booking notice requirements, and control the frequency of bookings.

## Buffer Times

Set buffer times to create breathing room around your meetings:

**Buffer Time Before Event** - The amount of free time you need before each scheduled event (0-120 minutes)

**Buffer Time After Event** - The amount of free time you need after each scheduled event (0-120 minutes)

## Scheduling Notice

Control how much advance notice is required for bookings:

**Minimum Notice** - How much time should be added before the event starts (0-120 minutes, hours, or days)

**Time Slot Interval** - How much time should be between each time slot (5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, or 60 minutes)

## Booking Frequency Limits

Control how many bookings can be made for this event type within specific time periods:

**Daily Limits** - Set maximum bookings per day (1-120)

**Weekly Limits** - Set maximum bookings per week (1-120)

**Monthly Limits** - Set maximum bookings per month (1-120)

You can combine multiple limit types (e.g., max 5 per day AND max 20 per month) to create comprehensive booking controls.
