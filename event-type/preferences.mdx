## Event Name Customization

You can customize the event name that appears in your calendar. This name will be used in three key places:

- **Internal calendar view** - How the event appears in your Novacal dashboard
- **Event listing page** - The display name in your events list
- **Connected calendars** - How the event appears in Google Calendar, Outlook, and other connected calendar services

### Dynamic Variables

To make your event names more personalized and informative, you can use these dynamic variables:

- `EVENT_TYPE_NAME` - The name of the event type
- `HOST_NAME` - The name of the person who is hosting the event
- `BOOKER_NAME` - The name of the person who booked the event
- `EVENT_DURATION` - Event duration (e.g., 30m, 1h 30m)

**Example:** Using `Meeting with BOOKER_NAME - EVENT_TYPE_NAME` would display as "Meeting with John Smith - 30-minute consultation" in your calendar.

### Default Naming Template

The default naming template for new events is `{{EVENT_DURATION}} meeting: {{HOST_NAME}} and {{BOOKER_NAME}}`. This name format helps provide clarity by showing the duration, the host, and the participant.

If you decide to customize the event name, your changes will replace this default format, allowing for a personalized presentation of your event types in all integrations and views.

## Event Type Color

You can set a custom color for each event type. This color will appear in:

- **Calendar view** - Helps you quickly identify different types of events at a glance
- **Events listing page** - Color-coded events for easy navigation and organization

Choose colors that help you distinguish between different event types and maintain a consistent visual system across your scheduling platform.

## Privacy Settings

### Hide from Profile Page

You can make an event type **secret** by hiding it from your public profile page. When hidden:

- The event type won't appear on your public booking page
- Only you can access and use this event type
- Useful for internal meetings, personal appointments, or event types you're not ready to make public yet

This gives you complete control over which event types are visible to potential bookers while keeping your internal scheduling organized.
