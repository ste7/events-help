# Email Notification Management

Novacal provides a comprehensive email notification system that puts you in control of your communication preferences. You can customize subject and content and other settings, and decide which notifications you want to receive and turn off any that you don't need.

## Our notification system includes:

**Reminder notifications** - by default sent 60 minutes before each event

**Confirmation notifications** - sent when bookings are confirmed

**Cancellation notifications** - sent when events are cancelled

**Update notifications** - sent when events are rescheduled or modified

## Customization

To customize, click on desired notification type and there you can edit settings with dynamic variables.

Customize your notification preferences in your event type settings to ensure you stay informed about the events that matter most to you.
