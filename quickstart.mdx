## Get started in three steps

To get started, sign in to your Novacal account and connect your preferred calendar. This ensures that your availability is always accurate and automatically updated. Once connected, you can define your working hours, meeting durations, and buffer times so that Novacal reflects your exact scheduling preferences.

### Step 1: Set Up Personal Details

Enter your name and choose a username. Your username will form part of your public booking link (for example:{" "} <code className="bg-gray-100 px-1 py-0.5 rounded text-sm font-mono"> novacal.com/username </code> ), so select something that is clear and professional. You will also set your timezone, which ensures all scheduling is automatically adjusted for regional differences, and select your preferred time format (12-hour or 24-hour). The chosen format will be applied consistently across the platform.

### Step 2: Availability

Define your schedule and main availability. These settings determine the time windows when others can book meetings with you. By setting your working hours, meeting durations, and buffer times, Novacal ensures that bookings are only offered during the periods you want to be available.

### Step 3: Calendar connection

Connect your external calendars, including Google Calendar, Outlook, and Apple Calendar. You can specify which calendar Novacal should use to check for conflicts, ensuring meetings are never double-booked. You can also choose where new booked events should be automatically added, so your schedule always stays synchronized.

### Step 4: Video Conferencing Apps

Link conferencing tools such as Google Meet or Zoom. Novacal will use your selected app as the default meeting location for new event types, though this can be changed later at any time. Please note that Google Meet requires at least one connected Google Calendar to function.

### Step 5: Profile details

Personalize your public booking page by uploading an avatar, writing a short “About” section, and adding social links. These details will be visible to anyone using your booking link, helping you create a professional and approachable presence.

Once onboarding is complete, your account is fully configured. You can immediately generate and share your first booking link to start scheduling meetings.

Now that you have your docs running, explore these key features:
