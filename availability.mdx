Your availability settings serve as the foundation for all your event types, defining when you're generally available for bookings. These global settings ensure consistency across your scheduling while allowing for flexibility in your daily routine. You can modify your working hours, time zones, and availability rules to ensure your schedule reflects your current availability and preferences. Changes to these global settings will affect all existing event types, but you can always override these settings for specific event types in their individual configuration.

## How to Override Default Availability

To override your default availability settings, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to edit Event Type">
    Go to your event type and navigate to the **Availability** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Override">
    Click the **Override Availability** button to start customizing your
    schedule.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Dates">
    Choose the specific dates you would like to override from the calendar
    interface.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Availability">
    - **Block entire day**: Leave the checkbox checked to make the selected
    dates completely unavailable for any bookings
    - **Set specific hours**:
    Uncheck the box to access time pickers where you can define exactly which
    hours you're available on those dates

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Important**: This override will apply to **all event types**! When you
  modify availability for specific dates, it affects your entire calendar across
  all your event types.
</Warning>

<Info>
  **Pro Tip**: Use this feature to handle holidays, personal time off, or days
  when your availability differs from your standard schedule.
