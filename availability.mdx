Your availability settings serve as the foundation for all your event types, defining when you're generally available for bookings. These global settings ensure consistency across your scheduling while allowing for flexibility in your daily routine. You can modify your working hours, time zones, and availability rules to ensure your schedule reflects your current availability and preferences. Changes to these global settings will affect all existing event types, but you can always override these settings for specific event types in their individual configuration.
