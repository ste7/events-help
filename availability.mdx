## Availability Profiles

You can create multiple availability profiles, each with its own timezone and weekly schedule. This allows you to have different availability rules for different event types.

Each availability profile includes:

- **Name**: A descriptive name for easy identification
- **Timezone**: The timezone for this availability schedule
- **Weekly Schedule**: Working days and time slots that repeat weekly
- **Event Type Assignment**: Assign one or more event types to use this availability

## Custom Availability Overrides

For each availability profile, you can override specific dates with custom availability. This allows you to:

- Set different time slots for specific dates
- Mark dates as completely unavailable
- Override availability independently for each availability profile

<Info>
  Custom availability overrides only affect the specific availability profile
  they belong to, allowing you to manage date-specific changes separately for
  different event types.
