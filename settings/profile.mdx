Your profile settings allow you to customize both your personal account preferences and your public presence on Novacal. You can update your personal details like timezone, time format, and start of week settings to ensure the platform works exactly how you prefer. Change your password for account security, manage your public profile information including your about section and social links that bookers will see, or delete your profile and all associated data if needed. These settings give you complete control over how you appear to clients and how the platform behaves for your workflow.
