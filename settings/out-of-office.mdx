In **Out of Office**, you can define periods when you're unavailable (e.g. vacation, sick leave). Bookers won't see any available slots on those dates.

## How to set out of office

1. Open the **dropdown** at the top of the sidebar, then click **Out of office**.
2. Click **Add out of office**.
3. Enter a **title** (e.g. "Vacation" or "Sick leave").
4. Pick the **date range** (start and end date) in the calendar picker.
5. Click **Create**.

To change or remove a period, use the **⋮** menu on the row and choose **Edit** or **Delete**.

## How it works

- Dates that fall within any out-of-office period are **blocked**: no slots are offered on those days for your event types.
- This applies to your default availability and any custom overrides: out-of-office takes precedence and removes those days from bookable availability.
- You can have multiple overlapping or separate periods; any date inside at least one period is blocked.

Use **Out of Office** when you know in advance you won't be available, so bookers only see times when you're actually free.
